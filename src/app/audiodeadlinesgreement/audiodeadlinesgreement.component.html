(“<b>ArtistXP</b>”) marketing affiliate program (the “<b>Affiliate Program</b>”), you agree to this ArtistXP Affiliate Program Agreement (this “<b>Agreement</b>”). You acknowledge and agree that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as well as all other applicable rules or policies provided by ArtistXP from time to time, including without limitation, the ArtistXP Terms of Use and Privacy Policy (collectively, the “<b>ArtistXP Policies</b>”), which are incorporated herein by reference and may be changed from time to time in ArtistXP’s sole and absolute discretion, and understand that you are entering into a legally binding agreement with ArtistXP.
<br><br>
        ArtistXP reserves the right to change and/or modify this Agreement  at any time in its sole discretion by posting a change notice or revised Agreement on www.artistxp.com (or any corresponding web page thereof) (the “ e”) or via your Affiliate Account (as defined below) or by sending notice of such modification to you by email to the primary email address then-currently associated with your Affiliate Account. The effective date of such change will be the date specified in such notice.

      </p>
      <h1>The Affiliate Program</h1>
      <p>The Affiliate Program provides the opportunity to earn commissions on qualifying purchases of tickets to view an Audio Deadline live-streamed event (an “<b>Event</b>”) online on the ArtistXP Site as follows, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement:</p>
      <ol class="loweralphabracket">
        <li>ArtistXP will provide unique tracking link(s) (which may include shared media links) to the ArtistXP Site (“<b>Links</b>”), which you may place on websites or social media user-generated content (collectively, “<b>Sites</b>”) that you own and/or control.</li>

          <li>For each person who arrives on the ArtistXP Site by clicking on a Link on one of your Sites (each, a “<b>Direct Referred Customer</b>”) and completes a Qualifying Purchase, you will earn a commission of 10% of the Net Receipts attributable thereto. A “<b>Qualifying Purchase</b>” occurs when a person arrives on the ArtistXP Site by clicking on a Link on your Site or the Site of a Direct Referred Affiliate or Indirect Referred Affiliate (as applicable), and, in the same transaction, purchases a ticket to an Event. “<b>Net Receipts</b>” means the monies actually received by ArtistXP from a Qualifying Purchase, less any chargebacks (and associated fees), credits, refunds, credit card processing fees and taxes (e.g., sales tax, VAT, etc.).  </li>

          <li>If a Direct Referred Customer participates in the Affiliate Program (any such Direct Referred Customer, a “<b>Direct Referred Affiliate</b>”), then, for each person who arrives on the ArtistXP Site by clicking on a Link on the Direct Referred Affiliate’s Site (each, an “<b>Indirect Referred Customer</b>”) and completes a Qualifying Purchase, you will earn a commission of 5% of the Net Receipts attributable thereto.
        </li>

      <p>Any dispute relating in any way to the Affiliate Program and/or this Agreement (including any actual or alleged breach hereof), whether arising in contract, statute, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, discrimination, common law or any other legal theory, including, but not limited to disputes relating to the making, performance or interpretation of this Agreement, shall be subject to binding arbitration, to be held in New York, New York, in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act and with the Commercial Rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association (“<b>AAA</b>”) available at www.adr.org.  In any arbitration proceeding conducted pursuant to this Section, the parties shall have the right to discovery, to call witnesses, and to cross-examine the other party’s witnesses.  The arbitrator shall render a final decision in writing, setting forth the reasons for the arbitration award.  Both parties are bound by this agreement to arbitrate.  THE PARTIES WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO HAVE ANY SUCH DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY DECIDED BY A JUDGE OR JURY IN A COURT.  THE PARTIES ALSO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR COLLECTIVE PROCEEDING.  If either party initiates or joins in a lawsuit or arbitration against the other party in violation of this waiver and a court or arbitrator deems the waiver to be unenforceable for any reason, then to the extent the waiver is invalidated, claims subject to the invalidated waiver shall no longer be subject to arbitration, but shall instead proceed in court, with all remaining claims remaining subject to arbitration.  To the extent claims subject to the invalidated waiver depend upon resolution of the same or similar facts as the claims to be arbitrated, the parties agree that such claims shall be stayed in court pending resolution of the arbitration.  This agreement to arbitrate claims does not include disputes, controversies or differences which may not by law be arbitrated.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, ArtistXP may seek injunctive or other relief in any state, federal, or national court of competent jurisdiction for any actual or alleged infringement of ArtistXP’s or any other person or entity’s intellectual property or proprietary rights. You further acknowledge and agree that ArtistXP’s rights in the Materials are of a special, unique, extraordinary character, giving them peculiar value, the loss of which cannot be readily estimated or adequately compensated for in monetary damages.
</p>
